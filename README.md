This is a react-web-app which uses the marvel's api to make a simple search engine
it allows the user to search the marvel character which were created in and after the 1970s

I found about this api on Instagram and i thought this would be a good idea to sharpen my frontend skills by using this api

I also want to thank MertStack for making such an educational video on this
You can view this web-app on http://localhost:3001/

I also want to say thank you to marvel for providing this api
